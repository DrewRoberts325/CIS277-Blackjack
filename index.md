# CIS 277 Final App

## Blackjack

I have created an app called Blackjack

Blackjack is just a simple gambling game that I though would be fun to create. It is made for those who
enjoy a nice and relaxing game of Blackjack without gambling money.
This app randomly selects a card and then puts it against the dealers card. Asking then if the player
would like to 'hit' or gain another card getting to or as close to 21 without going over.
The dealer will always hit when it has less cards then the player.
