# CIS 277 Final App

## Blackjack Card Game
# 5/5/19

I have created an app called Blackjack

Blackjack is just a simple gambling game that I though would be fun to create. It is made for those who
enjoy a nice and relaxing game of Blackjack without gambling real money.
This app randomly selects a card and then asks for a bet then drawing another randomly selected card
eventually having the goal of getting closer and closer to 21 and beating the dealers hand.

This app includes some concepts like keeping the cash through the next playtime, choosing whether
your ace is high or low, and adding a goal to trying to get to $10000 from the starting $500.

Hope you enjoy!
